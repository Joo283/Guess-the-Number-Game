# Guess the Number

**Guess the Number** is one of my first Java projects, created as part of my journey to learn and practice key concepts of the Java programming language. This project allowed me to explore:

- The role and functionality of **instance variables**.
- How **methods** interact within a class.
- The collaboration of **classes** in object-oriented programming.

## About the Project

In this project, **three users** take turns trying to guess a randomly generated number within a specific range. The game does **not provide feedback** on whether guesses are too high or too lowâ€”making it a straightforward test of random guesses and chance.

## Goals of the Project

The main objectives of this project were to:

- Reinforce my understanding of Java programming fundamentals.
- Experiment with coding logic, loops, and basic user interaction.
- Practice building simple yet functional multi-user applications.

## Features

- **Three players** compete to guess the number.
- No feedback is given after each guess, emphasizing randomness and chance.
- A simple design focusing on core programming concepts.

Feel free to explore the code, try the project, and share suggestions or ideas for improvement!
